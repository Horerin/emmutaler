A set of tools to enable fuzzing of the iPhone boot loader (and much more).
This was developed for my thesis.
For some more information of how certain parts of this work, see [my thesis](docs/thesis.pdf).

I plan on sharing my `*.idb` for the different SecureROMs sometime soon.
Need to first figure out whats the best way to do that :)

I also need to figure out a License for this (not sure if I am using anything that requires me to have a restrictive license).
If you need to use it urgently and are concerned about the license, let me know :)
